# Coding-Challenge-Customer-Support-Ticket-System-
Coding Challenge 14

Business Case:
A business wants to create a webpage to list unresolved customer support tickets. The tickets are available through an external API, but network issues or missing data could cause the page to break. Your task is to use async/await to fetch the data and ensure errors are caught and managed properly. If no tickets are found, you should throw a custom error stating, “No unresolved tickets available.”
